			Emily Blunt voices Juliet Capulet, a red gnome and one of the main protagonists. At first, she tries to outstrip the Blue gnomes by getting a special flower (the Cupid's Arrow Orchid) on top of a greenhouse, but after falling in love with the blue gnome Gnomeo, she, like Gnomeo, is no longer contemptuous towards the Blues. She tends to be stubborn and against being delicate, but can really care about her friends and tend to be a hopeless romantic. Juliet is feisty, willful, and not one to sit on the sidelines. She is delicate and lovely.
